Aziz Khan is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM), University of Oslo, Norway.

His primary research interests are bioinformatics, computational biology, machine learning and integrative analysis of high throughput sequencing data with an emphasis on regulatory genomics and epigenomics. The main focus of his recent research has been to develop computational tools and resources, and to perform integrative analysis, to understand transcriptional gene regulation. His long-term research goal is to develop computational methods and tools for integrative analysis of heterogeneous, high-throughput sequencing data to understand the transcriptional and epigenetic control of gene regulation in development and disease.

Apart from research, he is a strong advocate of open science, open source, open access, and the use of social media in research as a way to advance research more broadly.
