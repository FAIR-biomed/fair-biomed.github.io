I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM), University of Oslo, Norway. My primary research interests are gene regulation, computational biology, machine learning and integrative analysis of high throughput sequencing data with an emphasis on regulatory genomics and epigenomics. The main focus of my research is to develop computational methods and resources for integrative analysis of heterogeneous high-throughput sequencing data to understand the transcriptional and epigenetic control of gene regulation in development and disease.

Apart from research, I am a strong advocate of open science, open source, open access, preprints, reproducible research, and the use of social media in research as a way to advance research more broadly. I post [preprints](https://www.biorxiv.org/search/author1%3AAziz%2BKhan%20jcode%3Abiorxiv%20numresults%3A10%20sort%3Arelevance-rank%20format_result%3Astandard), publish [open access](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-6459-6224), share code freely on [GitHub](https://github.com/asntech/), and [tweet](https://twitter.com/khanaziz84) about it.
