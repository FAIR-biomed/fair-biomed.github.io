JASPAR is a widely used open-access database of curated, non-redundant transcription factor binding profiles. We have developed a brand new web interface using Django and also a REST API. The web app and REST API is implemented in Python using Django and Django REST Framework. It is accessible at http://jaspar.genereg.net and the source code is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/CBGR/jaspar under GPL v3 license.
