Vasts amounts of biomedical data are stored in open databases and knowledge-bases. Data in these resources are intended to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR</a>)). However, the data are distributed across many resources and integrating relevant parts within a specific project can be a challenge. FAIR-biomed works inside a web browser to bring a range of open-data resources - on genes, disease, genomic regions, variants - to any web-page.

FAIR-biomed is available as a free extension for Chrome or an add-on for Firefox.

Once installed, the extension is active on all web pages. Highlight some text, for example, a gene name. Press `Ctr+Shift+Z` on the keyboard, or right-click with the mouse and select `FAIR-biomed search`. A box should appear with suggestions of the biomedical data sources that might have more data pertaining to the highlighted text.

Clicking one of the options will trigger a query to the selected data service. A summary of the result will appear right-away, without the need to change browser tabs or to decipher external data portals.
