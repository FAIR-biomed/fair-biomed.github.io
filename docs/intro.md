FAIR-biomed is a browser extension for accessing open data resources in the biomedical domain. 

Vasts amounts of biomedical data are stored in open databases and knowledge-bases. Data in these resources are intended to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)). However, the data is distributed across many resources and integrating relevant parts within a specific project can be a challenge.

FAIR-biomed brings open data resources directly to specific research situations. Consider, for example, reading a report in the browser. With FAIR-biomed, you can access additional information on any part of the report without leaving the page.
