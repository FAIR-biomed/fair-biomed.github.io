Vasts amounts of biomedical data are stored in open databases and knowledge-bases. Data in these resources are intended to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable - [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618). However, the data are distributed across many resources and integrating relevant parts within a specific project can be a challenge. FAIR-biomed works inside a web browser to bring a range of open-data resources to any web-page.

Do you read content online and find the need to search for additional information about genes, diseases, genomic regions, or variants? FAIR-biomed provides information on biomedical concepts from up-to-date and reliable sources, without the need to leave the page.

FAIR-biomed is available as a free extension for Chrome or an add-on for Firefox.
