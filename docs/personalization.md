### Local URLs

The extension is automatically active on all pages that you accesss via urls starting with 'http' or 'https'. You can also use the extension with reports stored on your own computer, but this functionality is disabled by default by the chrome browser. To use this feature, you must enable it manually.
 
 - Select `Tools > Extensions` from the chrome menus; a new tab should appear listing all your installed extensions
 - Find `FAIR-biomed` and click `Details`; the view should change and display more details on the extension
 - Scroll down to the setting `Allow access to file URLs` and turn on the switch.

### Options

The extension has a dedicated page where you can tune which data sources you would like to use. 

 - Find the FAIR-biomed icon on the browser toolbar (it's usually on the top-right).
 - Click on the icon. A popup should appear. Click on the 'cogs' icon to open the Options page.
