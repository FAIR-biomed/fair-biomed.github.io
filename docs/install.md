FAIR-biomed can be installed in Chrome via the web store, in Firefox using the add-on manager, or from source.


## Using an extension manager

If you are using Chrome, navigate to the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fair-biomed/kaacnnmpcdbebmkbcddpckgpgphhcdhn) and click `Add to Chrome`.
  
If you are using Firefox, navigate to the [add-on manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/fair-biomed/) and click `Add to Firefox`. 

After clicking the `Add to ...` button, your browser will show some notifications. Read through the information boxes and confirm the installation. Once complete (it only takes a moment), the extension logo should appear beside the address bar, on the right hand side. 

*Note:* The information boxes will communicate that the extension will be able to read the web pages that you visit. This is necessary in order for the extension to read a highlighted piece of text and provide suggestion for querying biomedical resources. See the [privacy](../privacy/) page for more information on how the extension processes data.


## From source

The extension can also be installed from source. This is only necessary for development, i.e. to implement new features or add new plugins. The details are covered in the [developer documentation](../setup/) section.
