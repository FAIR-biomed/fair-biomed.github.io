FAIR-biomed can be installed in Chrome via the web store, in Firefox using add-ons, or from source.


## Chrome

Navigate to the FAIR-biomed page in the chrome web store, [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fair-biomed/kaacnnmpcdbebmkbcddpckgpgphhcdhn), and click `Add to chrome`. Read the information boxes and confirm the installation. Once installed, the extension logo should appear beside the address bar, on the right hand side. 


## Firefox

Once installed, the extension logo should appear beside the address bar, on the right hand side.



## From source

The extension can also be installed from source, bypassing the Chome web store or the Firefox add-on service. This is only necessary during a development cycle, i.e. if you want to implement new features or add new plugins. The details are covered in the [developer documentation](../setup/) section.
