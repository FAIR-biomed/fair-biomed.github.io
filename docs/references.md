## Open data

This project is possible because data producers and data curators make their work available online through application programming interfaces.

- The [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) principles describe principles for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. These principles, which have been influential in the field of open data both to promote good data management, motivate the name 'FAIR-biomed'.




## Browser extensions 

The idea of augmenting web pages with additional information has a long history. 

- [Reflect](https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Reflect%3A+augmented+browsing+for+the+life+scientist&btnG=) was an early implementation of a browser extension aimed at biomedical research. This extension sent a whole web-page to a server for annotation.
 
- [Dynamic linking](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4510879) outlined an idea to infer links to specialist sources by scanning the context of web pages.

- [GIX](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0477-9) described an extension for retrieving information on gene products.




## Software

The implementation of FAIR-biomed relies on several third-party software components.

- The extension relies on development frameworks/tools, [Babel](www.babeljs.io), [React](www.reactjs.org), [mocha](www.mochajs.org), and several other software libraries. The complete list is documented in the source code.
 
- Icons in the browser extension and on this website are from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
 
- This website is powered by [jekyll](www.jekyllrb.org) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
 
- This website is implemented using [bootstrap](www.getbootstrap.com).
