The plugin library provides access to a varied set of data sources.


## Gene-centric

Gene-centric plugins accept gene symbols as queries. Some of the plugins also accept identifiers, for example HGNC or MGI ids.

## Genome-centric

Genome-centric plugins accept genomic coordinates as inputs.

## Others

Certain plugins respond to queries that are neither gene symbols or genomic coordinates. As an example, plugins that link to databases of publications can display hits starting from queries on assay types, diseases, or authors.
